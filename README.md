<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Black Boxes are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understanding the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: over-speeding) is critical for the effective usage of the black box.</p>

<p>This project aims to implement the core functionalities of a car black box in a PIC-based microcontroller supported by its peripherals. Events will be logged in EEPROM in this project. This project can be extended further to any vehicle.</p>
